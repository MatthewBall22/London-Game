Matthew Ball coursework submission: The London Game

**Instructions**

The London Game is a board game based on the London Underground Tube Map. Players attempt to traverse the underground tube map to reach destinations while blocking other players from traversing the board

Setting up: 
Users can the number of players, player names, and icons for each player.

Dealing: 
Each player is dealt a set of destination cards that they must reach in order to complete the game. They can also be dealt some special "close station" cards"

Starting the game: 
Players must select a *train station* from which to begin their journey. They also select a line to start travelling on.

Actions: 
Each turn, a player has three possible actions. 
1. Roll a dice to move up to a certain number of stops along a line
2. Change lines at a station. Changing lines can trigger random events that cause hurdles for all players.
3. Use the action cards to open and change lines.

Winning:
In order to win the game, a player must stop at all their destination stations and then return to their original train station, before other players reach theirs.

Considerations:
It is not possible to pass through closed stations, so blocking off busy routes can cause significant trouble for players.
Rolling a six gives the player a special "open station" card that allows them to open closed stations.
Using a close station card closes it for all players, including the player who puts it down. This means that players should be cautious about blocking off important routes.
